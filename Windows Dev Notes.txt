Phase 1, 2, and 3 should be done in the first 10 minutes and entirely automated if possible.

- Script 1 to audit users and change passwords -> Shaheen
	- Probably best to do random passwords that output to a file. Make sure that this file isn't just left in plaintext on the Desktop.
	- Some issues with a predetermined password format.
- Script 2 to audit group memberships and check account privileges (password settings and pre-auth). Also check for local users (and probably delete them). -> Alex
	- Figure out what groups exists and what they do
	- I do not think that Windows boxes had local users last year, but we need to figure out what to do if we find them
- Script 3 for GPO -> Josh
	- Solution is to generate a GPO Report with powershell -> Get-GPOReport -All -ReportType HTML -Path "C:\AllGPOs.html"
	- This will only dump GPOs that are set, but it may be worth double-checking in the GUI for startup scripts

- Script 4 service hardening -> Edward, Wallace

Phase 4 is determined by what we actually need to be enabled for scoring, e.g. WinRM might not be necessary. Most of Phase 4 can probably be scripted

Phase 5 is probably mostly manual checking. At this point we can probably assume compromise, so it's time to hunt for IOCs and persistence. Not sure about automation for this process, but definitely playbooks for Phase 4 and 5.

After we are confident the red team is out, we can do things like set up event monitoring and hunt for privesc vectors with bloodhound and winpeas
