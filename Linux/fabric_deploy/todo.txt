============= check for unauthorized sudo =======
sudo	NOPASSWD:	/etc/sudoers
doas	nopass	/etc/doas.conf
run0	polkit.Result.YES	/etc/polkit-1/rules.d/*.rules
pkexec	polkit.Result.YES	/etc/polkit-1/rules.d/*.rules
su	Not natively supported*	Built-in (standard behavior requires password)

====== small tasks ===
fix time    sudo timedatectl set-ntp true
check internet works (ping 1.1.1.1)
check dns works (resolve example.com)
check locale settings (language, time)
review boot logs
check mounts and fstabs
Validate repo URLs, mirrorlists, proxies, and TLS CA bundles (bad CA store breaks everything).
check ulimit to make sure they are sane
check mail for root Mail spool

====== important =====
modify archive_ssh_keys.sh to not touch any black team accounts
make sure diff-changes.sh can diff against arbitirary snapshots (not just latest) (the hacky workaround would be to manually point the latest symlink to the folder you want)
make sure to add the new honeypot shell to /etc/shells

==== simplification ===
replace setup agent module with an extention to the users module    (might want to add a ssh key to the root and hardening user)


==== improve ====
lockdown.sh
    update lockdown to allow any port from trusted ips

ssh_hardening.py
    test

user_hardening.py
    have user hardening implant ssh keys for users

password generation:
    make sure `"`, `:`, `/` is not one of the passwd chars
